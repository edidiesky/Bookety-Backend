# How I Scaled Payment Gateways with the Adapter Pattern

Hey friends, Iâ€™m thrilled to share a recent win from my work at Chenst Management, where I used the **adapter pattern** to scale our payment gateway integrations for a platform serving 50,000+ concurrent users, making it seamless to onboard new providers and enhance system flexibility.

**The Problem**:  
Our payment system needed to support multiple gateway providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle transactions for our microservices-based platform. However, each provider had unique APIs and data formats, leading to complex, tightly coupled code that slowed development and made adding new providers a headache.

**What Led to the Problem**:  
Initially, our payment logic was hardcoded for each provider, resulting in duplicated code and maintenance challenges. As transaction volume grew, integrating new gateways required significant refactoring, risking delays and errors in our payment processing pipeline.

**The Solution: Adapter Pattern**  
To address this, I implemented the **adapter pattern** to standardize interfaces across payment providers. I designed a unified `PaymentAdapter` interface in TypeScript (e.g., `processPayment`, `refund`), with each provider-specific adapter implementing this interface. This abstracted provider-specific logic, allowing the core system to interact with a consistent API. For example:

```typescript
interface PaymentAdapter {
  processPayment(amount: number, userId: string): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  refund(transactionId: string): Promise<RefundResult>;
}

class StripeAdapter implements PaymentAdapter {
  async processPayment(amount: number, userId: string): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    // Stripe-specific logic
    return await stripe.payments.create({ amount, userId });
  }
  async refund(transactionId: string): Promise<RefundResult> {
    // Stripe-specific refund logic
    return await stripe.refunds.create({ transactionId });
  }
}

class PayPalAdapter implements PaymentAdapter {
  async processPayment(amount: number, userId: string): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    // PayPal-specific logic
    return await paypal.payments.execute({ amount, userId });
  }
  async refund(transactionId: string): Promise<RefundResult> {
    // PayPal-specific refund logic
    return await paypal.refunds.process({ transactionId });
  }
}
